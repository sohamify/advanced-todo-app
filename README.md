- **Backend**: Go + Fiber framework + MongoDB (Atlas)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Material UI + Zustand + React Hook Form + Zod + dnd-kit
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user registration & login
- **Features**: Drag-and-drop reordering, filtering, search, priority/status, deadlines, tags, responsive design

The project is structured as a **monorepo** with separate backend and frontend folders.
